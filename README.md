# Software-design-template

The client, "The Gaming Room" has a game application, Draw it Or Lose it, that was created for Andriod systems. The client was interested in expanding their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed enviorment. The Gaming Room wanted is to evlauate three traditional operating platforms (Linux, Mac and Windows), as well as mobile platforms. 

I beleive that I did a decent job creating this docuament and relaying the different advantages in terms of cost and effectiveness between using the different operating systems, I leanred a lot anout this topic when searching the different ways they are using in created an aplication. I wasnt aware of Lunix for exsample, I have seen that a lot of programers like to use it because it is open-source. 

When working through the design document, I found it helpful that I was writing out the process of using the operating system for the application that we where making, this gave me a better understanding of why I was designing the code the way it was, using this document will be very helpul for future projects. I feel like it is an essential part of making any application becuase often when reserching a topic you will find new ways of doing stuff that you may have not thought of before. 

I think I could of elaborated on the Architechtures portioin of the document. I wasnt too sure what this meant and kind of gave a broad definition on how this could be used for developing the software. 

Interperting the users needs is the moist important part becuase ultimatly they are paying for a company to impliment certain features of a product. I think it would get kind of easy to get carried away with a project and worry too much about different thnigs that could be added instead of doing what the client has asked us to do. When I was designing the software Ive been focusing heavily on making sure the formatting is good. In the past classes my formatting was not all that great and although I could get the software to work, it didnt always look the best but having a design template that I can referance will help me stay on task and have an outline of the porject so my lines of code can be clear and consise.
