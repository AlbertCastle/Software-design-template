# Software-design-template

The client, "The Gaming Room" has a game application, Draw it Or Lose it, that was created for Andriod systems. The client was interested in expanding their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed enviorment. The Gaming Room wanted is to evlauate three traditional operating platforms (Linux, Mac and Windows), as well as mobile platforms. 

I beleive that I did a decent job creating this docuament and relaying the different advantages in terms of cost and effectiveness between using the different operating systems, I leanred a lot anout this topic when searching the different ways they are using in created an aplication.
